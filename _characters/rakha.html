	<p>
	Rakha was featured in 'Best of Ringing 2021'.
	I was responsible for concepts, modeling, retopology, texturing and rigging 
	my character Rakha for our game Empyrean.

	<br>Set in a fantastic and mythical setting, Empyrean is a 3rd person shooter 
	game where Rakha is an invader looking to steal the power from 'The Sun Kingdom'. 
	Rakha's concept is inspired by Hindu and Buddhist cultures.
	I focused on creating a balance between his human-like body and his beast-like facial features.

	<br>Software used: Zbrush, Maya, Substance Painter, Photoshop and Unreal engine 4.
	Created in 2021.</p>
