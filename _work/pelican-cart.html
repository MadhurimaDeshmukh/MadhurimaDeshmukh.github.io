this shopping cart was inspired by the
pelicanâ€™s beak for hypermarkets. We want
to understand the factors that make users
experience a product as better as or worse
than another and as what it is that gives an
unexplained relationship with their
products.in this idea, the bag was
removable and is not a part of shopping cart
to be lighter and more compact compare to
existing designs. The ergonomic concepts
were investigated, also. The central of
gravity of the cart will close to the ground by
heavier loads, which makes the cart to be
more controllable for the users. The contact
parts were designed to be made from
antibacterial materials.</p>
