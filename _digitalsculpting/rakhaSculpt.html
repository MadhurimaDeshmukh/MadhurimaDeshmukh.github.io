Original Concept, sculpted using ZBrush. I was responsible for creating 
the character, Rakha in our game 'Empyrean'. 

<br>Set in a fantastic and mythical setting, Empyrean is a 3rd person shooter 
game where Rakha is an invader looking to steal the power from 'The Sun Kingdom'. 
Rakha's concept is inspired by Hindu and Buddhist cultures. I focused on creating a 
balance between his human-like body and his beast-like facial features.

<br>Software used: ZBrush and Photoshop. Created in 2021.</p>
