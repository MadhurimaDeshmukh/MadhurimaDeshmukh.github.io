I was responsible for concepts, modeling, retopology, texturing and rigging 
my character Rakha for our game Empyrean.

<br>Set in a fantastic and mythical setting, Empyrean is a 3rd person shooter 
game where Rakha is an invader looking to steal the power from 'The Sun Kingdom'. 
Rakha's concept is inspired by Hindu and Buddhist cultures.
I focused on creating a balance between his human-like body and his beast-like facial features.

<br>Software used: Zbrush, Maya, Substance Painter, Photoshop and Unreal engine 4.
Created in 2021.</p>
