        The posters were created for marketing the Solar Pups game.
        The player is able to generate their own posters with the dogs they own in the game. 
        The goal of the posters was to highlight the dog and use vibrant colors to make the poster eye-catching. 
        These posters were all composed in Unity using 3D props that were created just for marketing purposes.
