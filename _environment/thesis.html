    <p>
      My environment and Character were featured in 'Best of Ringing 2021'.
      This is my senior thesis game 'Empyrean' created 
      in collaboration with Sarah Benyona.
      Here are some progress shots and rendered assets. 
      I was responsible for Visual development, asset making using Maya, ZBrush and Substance Painter,
      and Level design and blueprinting in Unreal engine 4.</p>
