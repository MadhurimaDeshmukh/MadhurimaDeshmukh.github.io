        Hey there! I'm Madhurima Deshmukh, a 3D Character Artist and Digital Sculptor based in India. I grew up in India and completed my Multimedia Diploma in 2016 before heading to the USA in 2017 to pursue my passion for art at Ringling College of Art and Design. I graduated in 2021 with a BFA degree in 'Game Art and Design'. During my time in the USA, I've had the pleasure of working with small teams of game developers and have been professionally involved in the VR, AR, Web3, and Mobile Games Industry at CGO Studios and Krikey. 
        <br>In addition to my professional work, I enjoy baking and staying updated with new technologies.
