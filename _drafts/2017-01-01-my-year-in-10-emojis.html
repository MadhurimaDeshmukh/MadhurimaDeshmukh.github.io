<p>2015 was completely different from any other year. I made some small changes like eating more vegetables and some big changes like moving across the country. I am looking forward to 2016, but here is a little recap of my last year in emojis:</p>

<p>I got my first web development position after finishing General Assembly. I spent a few weeks with AutoLotto before taking a front end web developer position at Urban Influence.</p>

<p>This was probably my worst year of March Madness ever. I had Michigan State winning, but they got elminated in the first round by a 15th seed... But at least Villanova won!</p>

<p>I went on a cruise to Alaska. It was my first cruise and first non-beach/non-European vacation. I would highly recommend going to see how beautiful it is.</p>

<p>I closed out the year in Manuel Antonio, Costa Rica. Monkeys, sloths, and toucans, oh my.</p>

<p>And I still kept it 100.</p>

<p>Happy New Year!</p>
