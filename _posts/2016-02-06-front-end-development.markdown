I went back and finished Free Code Camp's Front End Development Program. 38 algorithms and 10 front end projects. I did a lot of it before starting General Assembly, but I wanted to go back and finish the remaining projects. I got to use some combination of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, AngularJS, CoffeeScript, and Jade (I do not really like Jade, but maybe it is because I am so use to seeing HTML).

All of the source code can be see on <a href="https://github.com/thomasvaeth/freecodecamp" target="_blank">GitHub</a> with a `README` file listing what was used for each project. Or you can just view the projects on <a href="http://codepen.io/thomasvaeth/" target="_blank">CodePen</a>.
