<p>I finished a third <a href="http://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/zipline-build-a-pomodoro-clock" target="_blank">project</a> on FreeCodeCamp. This one was to build a pomodoro clock. What is a pomodoro clock? It is a clock where you set how long you want to work on a task and how long you want to take a break before working again.</p>
