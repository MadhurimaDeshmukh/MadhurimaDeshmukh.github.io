<p>Week 6 is done. I am halfway finished with General Assembly Seattle. The last three weeks have been packed with full stack web applications. Week 4 started with only Express, EJS, and Body Parser. By the time week 5 ended I was using EJS Layouts, Sessions, and Sequelize. I spent all of week 6 working on my own full stack application that required at least user authorization with password encryption, two database models, one API, and a complete RESTful route. I made <a href="http://www.youarepizza.com" target="_blank">You Are Pizza</a>:</p>

<p>The idea of the project is to keep track of all the different pizzerias you have tried and to not just go back to the same place over and over again. I used bcrypt for the password encryption. My database model was the hardest part of the project. The two models I used were users and pizzerias, but I wanted to use a many to many relationship instead of a one to many relationship because I did not want to save the same pizzeria multiple times. It was easy to make the relationship, but took me a little time to get a delete function to work. I ended up using Ajax to delete from the join table. I also used five different APIs instead of only one: Yelp, HTML5 Geolocation, Google Maps Javascript, Google Maps Geocoding, and Instagram.</p>
<p>Next week: Ruby</p>
