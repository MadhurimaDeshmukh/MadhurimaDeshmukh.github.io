<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/thomasvaeth/0d11b9bcb7f5cce35a96.js"></script></p><p>I added Gulp to <a href="http://samesies.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">Samesies</a> like I said I was going to. All I am doing here is concatenating and minifiying the CSS and JS (separte from each other though). I also added a watch, so if anything changes it will run the process over again.</p><p>I better get a laptop sticker now.</p>
