<p>The first website I helped on at Urban Influence has received the Speical Kudos award from CSS Design Awards for today. The website was built for Quentin Tarantino's New Beverly Cinema, so we obviously had to go for the grindhouse and retro vibe. It is a custom WordPress website where everything can be managed from the admin dashboard (and I really do mean everything). All the movies and programs, the blog for the cinema and the blog for Tarantino, the staff's individual pages, the historic calendars, and the forum. It was nice to receive some recognition after all the merge conflicts we came across during development.</p>
