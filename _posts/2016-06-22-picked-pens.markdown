Another month of no personal projects. I did go to Alaska for a week, so that is a better excuse than last month of just not having enough time.

A couple hours before leaving for Alaska I got my first issue on GitHub for my <a href="https://github.com/thomasvaeth/freecodecamp" target="_blank">FreeCodeCamp</a> repository. FCC has updated the tests for some of their JavaScript challenges that I did last year and the solutions I had were now failing for users. Even though I had a problem it is rewarding to see where I was less than a year ago and knowing that some people are looking at what I have previously done for help. I was able to fix the issue right away for them and plan to go through some of the other challenges to update what I currently have.

Other than fixing reported issues on GitHub, I decided to continue doing a CodePen a week instead of doing something bigger. This month I converted more fonts to Base64, made another navigation, and played around with different box shadows. I also had two of them picked to be featured on the homepage.

I decided I am just going to make a collection of different navigations using Drake lyrics. I built this one because I had to do something similar in a project I was working on for a client. The navigation is displayed at the bottom of the section it is in and a class is being added when the user scrolls and it reaches the top of the window. No jQuery is being used here again.

Adidas was releasing another sneaker designed by Kanye West, so I had to do something special. I used `box-shadow`, `transition`, and `animation` to make this one. I have been seeing a lot of designs using a shadow on a link, so I wanted to do something fun with it. I have also been wanting to use the shake animation for a while, so it was perfect timing. It is probably my favorite CodePen to date and in a little over a week it has 1,915 views and 37 loves.

I was very surprised this one got featured on CodePen last night, but I am not going to complain about it. In a day it has 896 views and my LinkedIn has been getting a lot of views. I used `box-shadow` in the previous snippet I made, so I wanted to find an alternative to it. Here I am using a pseudo element that is absolutely positioned behind the link that is a solid colored rectangle and adding a transition to it.
