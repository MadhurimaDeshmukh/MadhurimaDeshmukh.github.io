It has been a month since the 12-week web development program has ended and I am still learning something new everyday. I decided to start learning Python after adding Gulp to my last project and changing my personal website to Jekyll.

I started with Codecademy and Treehouse tutorials. They both covered a lot of the same material, but each had a couple of different things that the other did not. Codecademy briefly covered bitwise operators and Treehouse covered `.format()` (instead of `%` like Codecademy) and `kwargs`. While they both went really slow for the level that I think I am at it was nice to make sure I covered everything. Now I am working on more "intermediate" tutorials and doing as many coding challenges as I can on <a href="http://www.codewars.com/users/thomasvaeth" target="_blank">Codewars</a>. Whatever challenge I do in JavaScript I try to redo it in Python.

One of my favorite things about Python so far is the syntax of it. The spacing matters. One of the most recent things I completed is writing Python better with the PEP 8 style guide.

At this point in learning Python I am not sure if I want to switch to Django/Flask or if I just want to continue reading through the language documentation.
