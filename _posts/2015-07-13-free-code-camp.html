FCC focuses on JavaScript and AngularJS. I have discovered over the past few weeks that I enjoy JS a lot more than Ruby. FCC is also constantly changing and updating their material (even over the past few days I have been on it). TOP has stopped updating their website because they recently launched a paid version. I was following TOP because I wanted to be building a portfolio at the same time. I have added more to <a href="https://github.com/thomasvaeth/freecodecamp" target="_blank">GitHub</a> in the past few days with FCC than I did in the past few weeks with TOP. I am solving problems by applying what I have learned in all the tutorials I completed and more. I am also learning a little Pig Latin!<br/></p><script src="https://gist.github.com/thomasvaeth/9ab12c85391166a58ec8.js"></script>
