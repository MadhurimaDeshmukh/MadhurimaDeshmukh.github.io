I made a Sass mixin for drawing a box around a button on hover using spans and psuesdo elements. I wrote this for a project I was working on, but decided to share it on CodePen because I liked it so much and it is really simple to use since it was a mixin. All it requires is two colors (I usually match the hover state to the `background-color` of the page). It also has optional agruments for `width`, `padding`, `transition-duration`, and `transition-delay` that can be changed.
