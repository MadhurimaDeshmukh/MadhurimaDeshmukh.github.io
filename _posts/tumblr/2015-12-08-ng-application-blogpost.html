<p>The past week and a half has been all about AngularJS and MongoDB. I really like AngularJS and I plan on using it in my final project. Today we had another hackathon to get more experience with it. This one was holiday themed, so I worked in a group with two other people and we made <a href="http://swtrwthr.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">this</a> in a few hours. We stored information on different ugly sweaters in MongoDB and used ng-repeat to display everything. We also used routing to make an admin section to add new sweaters instead of having to seed the database every time. It was great to work with a group again and a lot of fun to compete against each other in class.</p><p>Tomorrow: Visiting Expedia and starting React</p>
