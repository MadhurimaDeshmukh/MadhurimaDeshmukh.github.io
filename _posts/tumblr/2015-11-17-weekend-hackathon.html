<p>We got a break from Ruby on Rails this weekend (but that didn’t mean we had the weekend off)! Instead we had a weekend front end hackathon that turned out to be a lot of fun. The assignment was to build something cool while using a front end library that we have not used before. I made a completely random page doing a bunch of things that I have been wanting to do, but just have not been able to fit into previous projects.</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="571" data-orig-width="1024"><img src="http://40.media.tumblr.com/eced27297fdec19e57911ca4212c6726/tumblr_inline_nyrn0hNzom1t6kknv_540.png" data-orig-height="571" data-orig-width="1024" alt="image"/></figure><p>The libraries I used that I have not before were fullPage.js, Typed.js, Lettering.js, and BigVideo.js. I also got to add some different CSS properties like radial gradient and blend mode. You can view it on <a href="http://thomasvaeth.github.io/ga-hackathon1/" target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a>.</p>
