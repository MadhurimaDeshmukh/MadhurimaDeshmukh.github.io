<p>Week 6 is done. I am halfway finished with General Assembly Seattle. The last three weeks have been packed with full stack web applications. Week 4 started with only Express, EJS, and Body Parser. By the time week 5 ended I was using EJS Layouts, Sessions, and Sequelize. I spent all of week 6 working on my own full stack application that required at least user authorization with password encryption, two database models, one API, and a complete RESTful route. I made <a href="http://www.youarepizza.com" target="_blank">You Are Pizza</a>:</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="1606" data-orig-width="2880"><img src="http://40.media.tumblr.com/9d66a9ae882a3e6c37caa56eefab3b26/tumblr_inline_nxio3zr9bI1t6kknv_540.png" data-orig-height="1606" data-orig-width="2880" alt="image"/></figure><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="1608" data-orig-width="2880"><img src="http://40.media.tumblr.com/02ba612325b8457b6a192d5aee549112/tumblr_inline_nxio48ReAQ1t6kknv_540.png" data-orig-height="1608" data-orig-width="2880" alt="image"/></figure><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="1608" data-orig-width="2880"><img src="http://40.media.tumblr.com/5aca471154c6683b8a2736c21a67d38c/tumblr_inline_nxio48Umc81t6kknv_540.png" data-orig-height="1608" data-orig-width="2880" alt="image"/></figure><p>The idea of the project is to keep track of all the different pizzerias you&rsquo;ve tried and to not just go back to the same place over and over again. I used bcrypt for the password encryption. My database model was the hardest part of the project. The two models I used were users and pizzerias, but I wanted to use a many to many relationship instead of a one to many relationship because I didn&rsquo;t want to save the same pizzeria multiple times. It was easy to make the relationship, but took me a little time to get a delete function to work. I ended up using Ajax to delete from the join table. I also used five different APIs instead of only one: Yelp, HTML5 Geolocation, Google Maps Javascript, Google Maps Geocoding, and Instagram.</p><p>Next week: Ruby</p>
