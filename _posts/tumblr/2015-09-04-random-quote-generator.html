<p>I am learning more with FreeCodeCamp on my own than I thought was possible. I am very happy with my progress leading up to the General Assembly Seattle web development immersive program that I start later this month. I completed a basic front end development project yesterday, but I am still making a few tweaks here and there based on feedback and new ideas. <br/>The <a href="http://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/zipline-build-a-random-quote-machine" target="_blank">project</a> was to make a random quote generator that the visitor could see new quotes and tweet one if they would like. I decided to make one with Star Wars quotes because I just started watching the movies this week and thought it would be fun to do with the new movie coming out soon.</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="1534" data-orig-width="2880"><img data-orig-height="1534" data-orig-width="2880" alt="image" src="http://41.media.tumblr.com/119274b6996a9ea558bfc775a744b073/tumblr_inline_nu5ukbt4Pw1t6kknv_540.png"/></figure><p>I have been using Bootstrap for all of my front end development projects lately. I love how easy it is to use and how great the pages look using it. But the main point of this project was to get some JavaScript and jQuery practice.</p><script src="https://gist.github.com/thomasvaeth/99f0e3e7304f90f82668.js"></script><p>One quote is picked at random from an array of quotes in the function. The quote is checked for length since 140 characters is the maximum for a tweet and a hashtag, emoji, and link are being added. C-3PO has an emoji available that I wanted to use, so those quotes have to be checked separately. If the quote is small enough then it is being added to the HTML classes. New variables are also being set to use in the jQuery for the visitor to be able to send a tweet.<br/>In the jQuery the tweet button is initially hid. Originally the visitor was able to tweet the landing page quote, but I wanted them to generate a new quote. Once the visitor clicks to generate a new quote the tweet button will show again. The tweet button will also have a new link attributed to it that will generate a tweet for the quote currently on the page.<br/>You can view the project on <a href="http://codepen.io/thomasvaeth/full/epmrEm/" target="_blank">CodePen</a> and get all of the code on <a href="https://github.com/thomasvaeth/freecodecamp/tree/master/random-quote-machine" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p><figure data-orig-width="1080" data-orig-height="575" class="tmblr-full"><img src="http://41.media.tumblr.com/14473378bc409ef6f5eaf7f4abbac7bb/tumblr_inline_nu5x8qnsXq1t6kknv_540.png" data-orig-width="1080" data-orig-height="575" alt="image"/></figure><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/C3PO?src=hash">#C3PO</a> said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get technical with me.&rdquo; <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/StarWars?src=hash">#StarWars</a> <a href="https://t.co/ynE1eTq7EQ">https://t.co/ynE1eTq7EQ</a></p><div>â€” Thomas Vaeth (@thomasvaeth) </div><a href="https://twitter.com/thomasvaeth/status/639840482143502337">September 4, 2015</a></blockquote>
