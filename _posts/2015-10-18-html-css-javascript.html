<p>I cannot believe General Assembly Seattle is already finished with week 3. I am a quarter way through the web development immersive program. In the beginning I was worried that I overprepared, but by the end of week 2 I was already learning all new information. It took a week and a half of class to catch up to what I learned in 4 months on my own. One of my favorite topics so far that I loved learning about was the Document Object Model (DOM) instead of using jQuery. DOM is something that I would have never thought to teach myself because I could just attach a script for the jQuery library, but it was good to learn.</p>
<p>In the first three weeks we had a few small projects (all in a private repository on GitHub) and one big project that we finished on Thursday. The small projects were Tic Tac Toe using DOM, a to do list using jQuery (I also used jQuery UI and the OMDb API), and an image search using the Reddit API. Here are some screenshots from each small project:</p>

<p>The big project was to build our own game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I chose to build Simon because it was one of my favorite childhood games. I built the game without thinking of a mobile version at first and then got to try out media queries for the first time. I only had time to test on Google Chrome, but portrait looks good and landscape needs a little work. I also added Animate.CSS for some effects instead of making my own keyframes. You can play the game and get all of the code on <a href="http://thomasvaeth.github.io/ga-simon/" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. I would love if you starred or forked my repository. Here is a screenshot of the desktop CSS:</p>
