<p>I finished a third <a href="http://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/zipline-build-a-pomodoro-clock" target="_blank">project</a> on FreeCodeCamp. This one was to build a pomodoro clock. What is a pomodoro clock? It is a clock where you set how long you want to work on a task and how long you want to take a break before working again.</p>

<p>I made the project harder than it needed to be and I am disappointed in that, but I got to learn a lot and that is why I am doing these projects. I used .hide(), .show(), and repeated myself too much. I tried to remove as much repeating code as I code, but couldn&rsquo;t do it with everything. Here is an example of trying to remove some repeating code from the timers:</p>

<p>There was nothing else I could think of doing at the time. I am hoping that I will be able to improve on it as I learn more by building more projects.</p>

<p>You can view the project on <a href="http://codepen.io/thomasvaeth/full/QjwPgz/" target="_blank">CodePen</a> and get all of the code on <a href="https://github.com/thomasvaeth/freecodecamp/tree/master/pomodoro-clock" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>
