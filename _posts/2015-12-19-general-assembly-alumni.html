<p>General Assembly Seattle is over. I am now a web developer. My final project was <a href="http://samesies.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">Samesies</a>. The project did not really have any requirements besides being a full stack application, so Samesies was built using the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express, AngularJS, and Node.js). The idea of the project was to make a handful of templates and have them available to download for a small fee or for free all in one place.</p>

<p>The hardest part of the project was adding a password confirmation. I tried to add a custom directive, but I just was not getting it. I think if I had more time I would have been able to figure it out, but I took on a lot for a four day project. I ended up using a node module called angular-validation-match and used ng-show/ng-hide for a button. It may not be the best way, but it worked.</p>

<p>Here are screenshots of the single page templates I made for the project:</p>

<p>I want to keep adding templates to the project during my free time, but I think the next thing I am going to do is add Gulp. We barely touched on Gulp during class when going over React, so I want to get more comfortable with it.</p>
