<p>I started working on <a href="http://www.theodinproject.com/home" target="_blank">The Odin Project</a>.
 I have gotten through HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery in Web Development 101 over the past 
week. I like
 the structure of the curriculum. The 
main reason I decided to follow TOP was because I wanted to be building a portfolio at the same time. I have already replicated the Google homepage with HTML and CSS, solved a few math problems with JS, and made an etch-a-sketch using jQuery. Doing a project for every section helps me a lot because I still do not know everything and I need to do some research to figure it out. Here is a 
snippet of jQuery that changes the color of a block on a grid to black 
when you hover over it. You can get the rest of the code <a href="https://github.com/thomasvaeth/the_odin_project/tree/master/etch-a-sketch">here</a>.</p><script src="https://gist.github.com/thomasvaeth/36049c9b9028f29cc67c.js"></script><p>I finished Ruby tonight and plan on starting RSpec tomorrow. That means I am only a few days away from working on some more exercises to push to GitHub.<br/></p>
